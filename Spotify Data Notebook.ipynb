    "Section 3 is extracting N songs randomly from a given dataset, either randomly or with a weighted random distribution. You can set the constants to change the sampling method, number of songs, and the dataset you are computing over. If you use the default dataset to pick the songs, it is quite slow (takes like 10 minutes overall), so you may want to use a smaller dataset to choose these songs. I set the dataset to the dataset containing playlists with over 5 followers and it is significantly quicker to run. "

    "\n",
    "### How this works:\n",
    "\n",
    "First we consider the one node case. We feed a single node, call it node A, into the algorithm which gives us the subset of the network with one edge at A, which is a star graph. We store this star graph in a dictionary object. The next song to be recommended is one of the edges in this graph, randomly chosen with a weighted probability distribution. Call this song B. Now, we want the playlist that we are generating to be the center of the star graph. Now, we make the center of the star graph represent both nodes A and B. We add all the edges with end to B (except those with end A) from the original dataset to the star graph. If an edge already exists between the center and another node, and B is also connected with that node, the new weight of that edge becomes the sum of the weights of those edges. This is to implement familiarity. Continue this until the desired playlist size is reached. "
